# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Somesh Kumar Singh, currently in my third year of B. Tech (CS - AIML)  at GLBITM. My passion is to learn different coding languages. For now, I am a beginner and am putting my efforts to sharpen my skills.
Reactive Behavior and Swift action was one of the key skills which I learned quite early because I was a chess player in myÂ teenage. Sports enables one to learn key skills which I still apply in my studiesÂ andÂ work.
